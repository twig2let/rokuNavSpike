anyone interested.. I’ve just made available some code I had on bitbucket for a while, which is a base implementation I use for navigation in roku apps.

It’s not documented like my  other projects; but it does demonstrate:
- using base views
- using base screens
- abstracting view management into BaseAggregateView, TabController and NavController
- makes use of my rLog framework
thought perhaps someone here might like to peruse the patterns I employ, to abstract common roku app functionality (view lifecycle/keypresses/focus management/view composition and aggregation).
