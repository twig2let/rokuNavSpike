    <!-- Describes the current playback selection. It is possible that playback for a group of items 
    originates from a view, like a grid, or a rail. 
    This abstraciton allows us to make assumptions about a user's selection intent
    without having to pass around pieces of state.
    
    Because playback is an atomic operation, views can set the state of this object before playback occurs
    to ensure that the state always reflects user actions
